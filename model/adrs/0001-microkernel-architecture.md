# 1. Microkernel architecture

Date: 2023-4-19

## Status

~~Accepted~~ --> Invalid

## Summary  

*In the context of* delivering an word memorize software,  
*facing* the proposal proposed by the project proposal, a third party can expand the functions according to our architecture,  
*we decided* to to use microkernel architecture to improve extensibility,  
*to achieve* consistent logical behaviour across platforms,  
*accepting* potential complexity of interfaces to different platforms.

## Context

- The system will have a front-end and a back-end.
    - The front-end can complete complex logical behaviors according to the user's behavior, generate an instruction and send it to the back-end to query the dictionary
    - The back-end only needs to be responsible for executing the instructions transmitted by the front-end and connecting to the database, and then sending back data such as dictionary definitions
- Delivering functional requirements requires complex processing and database transactions.
    - Progress based on both a user's history and behaviour.
    - Recording all users' word history.
    - Team fuction.
    - In order to ensure security, an expirable token should be generated when the user logs in and then stored in redis
- Development team has experience using Python.

## Decision

All logic will be implemented in front-end of the software architecture.
Web and mobile applications will implement the interaction tier.
Front-end communicate with the back-end to access database.
This provides clear separation of concerns and ensures consistency of logic across front-end and back-end.

The front-end logic will be implemented in React.
The back-end logic will be imeplemented in Python.
The project will be deployed on AWSã€‚
The data would store in PostgreSQL on AWS.
This suits the current development team's experience and is a common environment.

## Consequences

Advantages
- After the user caches the dictionary, it can be used locally without networking
- Reduced the servers load
- If the users hardware is good, the responsiveness would increaseconsumes more memory on the user's system

Disadvantages
- The development team lacks front-end development experience.
- The front-end load was increased
- Would consumes more memory on the user's system
