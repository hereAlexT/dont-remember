Date: 2023-04-28

## Status

Accepted

## Summary
We assume that our product is toB, because the toC is to competitive in this niche market.
Since many companies want to integrate external tools into their existing system, we only need to provide a suite of APIs
After discussing with our course lecturer, instead of developing a frontend, we develop a CLI tool for demonstration purposes.

## Context

- Our team has no experience in frontend development, especially with React.
- A demo tool is necessary to show the business logic of our software.


## Decision

- Replace the React frontend with a CLI tool.

## Consequences

Advantages:

- The team has experiences in CLI development.
- Development costs are lower as the CLI doesn't require cloud deployment.

## Disadvantages

- The use of CLI tool is not as intuitive as the React frontend.
- For the user experience, the CLI tool doesn't perform as well as the React frontend.
